This is my CocktailDB app 🍸, a web page that displays a list of cocktails and their details, made with React and consuming the CocktailDB API.  

Upon visiting the page, users will be able to search for cocktails using the search bar. Once a cocktail is selected, its details, including its name, ingredients, instructions, and a photo, will be displayed.
